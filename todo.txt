sub where
	- From can be filled with tables before the joins are supplied (csv, multiple calls)
	- Get the right dictionary for the join-on clause (positional)
	- How to know when were done with this dictionary?
	- Limit from to one entry per call might be only solution

sub from/join
	- From is not adhering to the structure where needs
	- Dictionary of Dictionary => ExprDictionary (always)
	
Ideas/Other:
The where clause needs and/or logic structures
And/Or Methods, implicit anding between consecutive wheres
Table joining and overall naming/structure still undecided

The reason for making a custom dictionary object is any good SQL engine allows you to select the same column with multiple values.
Ala: select 1 as data, 2 as data from dual; (mysql, sqlite)

A hash would overwrite the second column,
So a dictionary object that allows multiple equal keys and indexes by key was created.

ExprDictionary is quite simply a dictionary with an additional layer of mapping.

expr_dict key => new dictionary
