sub where
	- From can be filled with tables before the joins are supplied (csv, multiple calls)
	- Get the right dictionary for the join-on clause (positional)
	- How to know when were done with this dictionary?
	- Limit from to one entry per call might be only solution

sub from/join
	- From is not adhering to the structure where needs
	- Dictionary of Dictionary => ExprDictionary (always)
	
Ideas/Other:
ExprDictionary will be used for where clause
allows for and/or chaining, and by nesting ExprDictionaries 
and/or with parens can be represented.

The where clause needs and/or logic structures
And/Or Methods, implicit anding between consecutive wheres
Table joining and overall naming/structure still undecided
